# 🏢 Enterprise Active Directory Lab

**Simulated Corporate Environment – Northbridge Solutions Inc.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a structured Windows Server domain environment designed to demonstrate practical Level 1 and Level 2 IT Support skills.

The lab models:

* Organizational Unit (OU) design
* User account lifecycle management
* Security group implementation (AGDLP)
* Client domain join
* DNS troubleshooting
* Account lockout and password scenarios

---

# 🏗️ Lab Environment Architecture

**Domain:** lab.local
**Domain Controller:** DC01
**Client Machine:** CLIENT01
**Network Type:** Internal Network (VirtualBox)
**DNS:** Hosted on Domain Controller

| System   | Role                     | IP Address                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| DC01     | Domain Controller + DNS  | 192.168.10.10                 |
| CLIENT01 | Windows 10 Domain Client | Configured to use DC01 as DNS |

# 🧩 Business Scenario

Company: **Northbridge Solutions Inc.**

Departments simulated:

* DevDept
* ExecDept

Each department contains:

* Dedicated OU structure
* Security groups
* Department users
* Controlled access to shared resources

This mirrors enterprise directory design.

# 🔐 Active Directory Structure

## Organizational Unit Design

```
lab.local
│
├── DevDept
│   ├── Users
│   └── Computers
│
├── ExecDept
│   ├── Users
│   └── Computers
```
## DevTeam OU Structure

![DevTeam OU Structure](screenshots/DevTeam_OU_Structure.PNG)

### Note:

* Enables targeted Group Policy
* Organizes users logically
* Simplifies onboarding/offboarding
* Prevents administrative clutter

---

# 👤 User Lifecycle Management

Practiced tasks:

- **Create users** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/create-user.png)
- **Reset passwords** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/reset-password.png)
- **Unlock locked accounts** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/unlock-account.png)
- **Force password change at next logon** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/force-password-change.png)
- **Disable accounts** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/disable-account.png)
- **Re-enable accounts** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/reenable-account.png)
- **Move users between OUs** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/move-user-ou.png)
- **Add users to security groups** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/add-user-group.png)

### Help Desk Scenarios Simulated

| Scenario            | Resolution                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| User locked out     | Unlock account in ADUC                          |
| Password expired    | Reset password and force change                 |
| Employee terminated | Disable account                                 |
| Department transfer | Move user to new OU and update group membership |

# 🛡️ Security Group Strategy (AGDLP Model)

Implemented Microsoft best practice:

**Accounts → Global Groups → Domain Local Groups → Permissions**

### Example

```
User (JDavis)
   ↓
GG_DevTeam_Users (Global)
   ↓
DL_DevShare_RW (Domain Local)
   ↓
NTFS Permissions on Shared Folder
```

### Why This Matters

* Prevents direct user-to-resource permissions
* Keeps ACLs clean
* Simplifies access changes
* Reflects enterprise security standards

---

# 💻 Client Deployment & Domain Join

Tasks completed:

* Installed Windows 10 on CLIENT01
* **Configured networking to communicate with DC01** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/disable-account.png)
* Verified connectivity using:
  * **ping** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/Client01_PingTest_TO_DC01.png)
  * **ipconfig** – [View Screenshot](screenshots/disable-account.png)
* Corrected DNS misconfiguration
* Joined CLIENT01 to lab.local domain
* Logged in using domain user account
* Verified authentication

---

# 🌐 DNS & Network Troubleshooting

Configured DC01 as DNS server.

Validated:

* Client DNS points to 192.168.10.10
* Domain resolution works
* Login failures traced to DNS misconfiguration
* Resolved “Destination Host Unreachable” error

## DC01 DNS Configuration

![DC01 DNS Configuration](screenshots/DC01_DNS_Configuration.PNG)

Note:

*Active Directory depends entirely on correct DNS configuration.
*Validates the Client 01 points to DNS Server
*Authenicate User and process Group policies
*If DNS is wrong, everything is wrong
